    private Map<User, String> allUsers; uses User as the key, should override hashcode and equals method
    allUsers is not initialized, will cause NPE in loadAllusers
    if (allUsers.get(user) == userStatusActive)   should use equals
    resetUserPassword case should be a string constant
    if (status.equals(userStatusActive) | status.equals(userStatusPending))   should be "||"

    allUserLoaded changed in another thread never been picked up in the method printAllUsers, will be always false
    if allUserLoaded is true, then every time a scheduled executor along with a job will be created.
